## Summary:

I built the clock app within a day. I want to incorporate the DRY (don't repeat yourself) programming concept and make it more modular for readability. I want to make sure this app is also viewable on mobile devices.

Ever since I learned how to code, I always want to make my code readable and easy to debug. That is my goal in building this despite the simple functionality of the app.
